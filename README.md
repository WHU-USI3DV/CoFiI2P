<strong>Abstract:</strong> â€”Image-to-point cloud (I2P) registration is a fundamental task for robots and autonomous vehicles to achieve crossmodality data fusion and localization. Current I2P registration methods primarily focus on estimating correspondences at the
point or pixel level, often neglecting global alignment. As a result, I2P matching can easily converge to a local optimum if it lacks high-level guidance from global constraints. To improve the success rate and general robustness, this paper introduces CoFiI2P, a novel I2P registration network that extracts correspondences in a coarse-to-fine manner. First, the image and point cloud data are processed through a two-stream encoder-decoder network for hierarchical feature extraction. Second, a coarseto-fine matching module is designed to leverage these features and establish robust feature correspondences. Specifically, In the coarse matching phase, a novel I2P transformer module is employed to capture both homogeneous and heterogeneous global information from the image and point cloud data. This enables the estimation of coarse super-point/super-pixel matching pairs with discriminative descriptors. In the fine matching module, point/pixel pairs are established with the guidance of superpoint/super-pixel correspondences. Finally, based on matching pairs, the transform matrix is estimated with the EPnP-RANSAC algorithm. Experiments conducted on the KITTI Odometry dataset demonstrate that CoFiI2P achieves impressive results, with a relative rotation error (RRE) of 1.14 degrees and a relative translation error (RTE) of 0.29 meters, while maintaining realtime speed. These results represent a significant improvement of 84% in RRE and 89% in RTE compared to the current state-ofthe-art (SOTA) method. Additional experiments on the Nuscenes datasets confirm our methodâ€™s generalizability.

## ðŸš… Usage

### KITTI data preprocessing
You could download the processed data [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ykHg5y65Qsp0tMpiZ8lRZvydpIXrO_4D)(~102G) or process it from source. For more details, please refer to [CorrI2P](https://github.com/rsy6318/CorrI2P).

### Nuscenes data preprocessing 
~~Due to the extremely large scale of processed data (200G approximately), we only provide the data pre-processing code now.~~ 

You could download the processed data [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12rzj-16SKO-uaXYWpRo1_lpQyLKNxtSj/view?usp=sharing)(~124G). If you want to build the ``Nuscenes_I2P`` data from source, please download the source data [here](https://www.nuscenes.org/nuscenes) and refer to following steps for building image-to-point cloud registration data:
- build datainfo:
```
python -m data.build_nuscenes.build_datainfo
```
- build dataset:
```
python -m data.build_nuscenes.build_dataset
```
**Please reserve enough space for processed Nuscenes dataset (200G+) !!!**

### Evaluation
For the KITTI Odometry dataset and Nuscenes dataset, we provide pre-trained models on [OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AhENMf-PTXKL0Bq11ewNUGBbA9m3?e=xGthS3) and [Baidu Disk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Vo4WiyJ6J4sKgveFXrycVQ?pwd=51p0).
Please download the weights of CoFiI2P from webdrive and put them in a folder like ```ckpt/```.
Example: evaluate ```CoFiI2P``` on the KITTI Odometry dataset

```
python -m evaluation.eval_all ./checkpoints/cofii2p_kitti.t7 kitti
```
Above operation calculates the per-frame registration error and save intermediate results.

Then:
```
python -m evaluation.calc_result
```
The evaluation results on the KITTI Odometry dataset should be close to:
```
RRE = 1.25 Â± 0.85, RTE = 0.28 Â± 0.16
```
The evaluation results on the Nuscenes dataset should be close to:
```
RRE = 2.61 Â± 9.70, RTE = 1.24 Â± 8.86
```

### Training
Example: train ```CoFiI2P``` on the KITTI Odometry dataset
```
python -m train kitti
```
